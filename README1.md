Welcome to Stellar Resource Usage! This tool is designed for Web3 developers working on the Stellar network, providing a convenient way to monitor and analyze the resources consumed by smart contracts during execution. This enables developers to optimize contract performance effectively.

# Features Overview

1. **Real-Time Resource Monitoring**: The tool monitors resource usage in real-time during smart contract execution, including `cpu_insns`, `mem_bytes` ect. for more information,see the [supported resource documentation](./docs/RESOURCE_LIMITS_DESC.md).


1. **Detailed Report Generation**: After contract execution, the tool generates a detailed report to help developers gain deeper insights into resource usage.


1. **Easy to use**: The amount of intrusion code is very small and it is easy to use.


1. **Open Source Contribution**: As an open-source project, we welcome community contributions, including bug fixes, feature enhancements, and improvement suggestions.


# Installation Guide
To install and run Stellar Resource Usage locally, follow these steps:


1. Install dependencies:

```sh
npm i stellar-resource-usage
```

**pnpm**

```sh
pnpm add stellar-resource-usage
```

**bun**

```sh
bun add stellar-resource-usage
```

# Usage Instructions

1. Make sure Docker Desktop is running on your system

2. Start the unlimited network simulator. Executing the code below will launch a [stellar/quickstart](https://github.com/stellar/quickstart) image. You can also customize your own image according to the *quickstart* if you want.

 _Note: Using npx requires you to install npm globally in advance, more info please refer to [npx](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npx)_

```sh
npx dockerDev [--port=your port] # The default port is 8000 
```

3. Make sure you have seen a steady stream of *stellar-core: Synced!* logs in `step 2`. Deploy your contract once your local network is running. If you donâ€™t know how to deploy a contract, you can check the [Stellar build doc](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/smart-contracts/getting-started) or the [deploy.example.ts](./deploy.example.ts) we provide for reference.

### Scenario 1

1. When you generate a typescript module using the `stellar contract bindings` command, and use the `Client` in this module to call and execute the contract functions:

```js
import { Keypair } from "@stellar/stellar-sdk";
import { basicNodeSigner } from "@stellar/stellar-sdk/contract";

import { Client, networks } from "path/to/module";

const callContract = async () => {
  try {
    const keypair = Keypair.fromSecret(Bun.env.SECRET!);
    const pubkey = keypair.publicKey();

    const { signTransaction } = basicNodeSigner(
      keypair,
      networks.standalone.networkPassphrase
    );

    const _contract = new Client({
      contractId: networks.standalone.contractId,
      networkPassphrase: networks.standalone.networkPassphrase,
      rpcUrl: "http://localhost:8000/soroban/rpc",
      publicKey: pubkey, // process.env.SOROBAN_PUBLIC_KEY,
      allowHttp: true,
      signTransaction,
    });
    await _contract.run({
      cpu: 700,
      mem: 180,
      set: 20,
      get: 40,
      events: 1,
      _txn: Buffer.alloc(71_680),
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};

callContract();

```

2. Add the `stellar-resource-usage` library:

```js
import { Keypair } from "@stellar/stellar-sdk";
import { basicNodeSigner } from "@stellar/stellar-sdk/contract";
// Add ResourceUsageClient
+ import { ResourceUsageClient } from "stellar-resource-usage";

import { Client, networks } from "path/to/module";

const callContract = async () => {
  try {
    const keypair = Keypair.fromSecret(Bun.env.SECRET!);
    const pubkey = keypair.publicKey();

    const { signTransaction } = basicNodeSigner(
      keypair,
      networks.standalone.networkPassphrase
    );

-    const _contract = new Client({
+    const _contract = await ResourceUsageClient<Client>(Client, {
      contractId: networks.standalone.contractId,
      networkPassphrase: networks.standalone.networkPassphrase,
      rpcUrl: "http://localhost:8000/soroban/rpc",
      publicKey: pubkey, // process.env.SOROBAN_PUBLIC_KEY,
      allowHttp: true,
      signTransaction,
    });
    await _contract.run({
      cpu: 700,
      mem: 180,
      set: 20,
      get: 40,
      events: 1,
      _txn: Buffer.alloc(71_680),
    });

+   _contract.printTable();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};

callContract();
```

### Scenario 2
...

3. Execute the file

For typescript files, we recommend using `bun` to run directly, which makes the command very simple, just execute `bun run filepath`. then you will see the reporter in the console.
