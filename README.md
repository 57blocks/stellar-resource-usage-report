# Stellar Resource Usage

Welcome to Stellar Resource Usage! This tool is designed for Web3 developers working on the Stellar network, providing a convenient way to monitor and analyze the resources consumed by smart contracts during execution. This enables developers to optimize contract performance effectively.

![Result table](./public/report.png)

# Features Overview

1. **Real-Time Resource Monitoring**: The tool monitors resource usage in real-time during smart contract execution, including `cpu_insns`, `mem_bytes` ect. for more information,see the [supported resource documentation](./docs/RESOURCE_LIMITS_DESC.md).


1. **Detailed Report Generation**: After contract execution, the tool generates a detailed report to help developers gain deeper insights into resource usage.


1. **Easy to use**: The amount of intrusion code is very small and it is easy to use.


1. **Open Source Contribution**: As an open-source project, we welcome community contributions, including bug fixes, feature enhancements, and improvement suggestions.


# Installation Guide
To install and run Stellar Resource Usage locally, follow these steps:


1. Install dependencies:

Using npm:
```sh
npm i @57block/stellar-resource-usage
```

Using pnpm:

```sh
pnpm add @57block/stellar-resource-usage
```

Using bun:

```sh
bun add @57block/stellar-resource-usage
```

# Usage Instructions

1. Make sure Docker Desktop is running on your system

2. Start the unlimited network simulator. Executing the code below will launch a [stellar/quickstart](https://github.com/stellar/quickstart) image. You can also customize your own image according to the *quickstart* if you want.

 _Note: Using npx requires you to install npm globally in advance, more info please refer to [npx](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npx)_

```sh
npx dockerDev [--port=your port] # The default port is 8000 
```

3. Make sure you have seen a steady stream of *stellar-core: Synced!* logs in `step 2`. Deploy your contract once your local network is running. If you donâ€™t know how to deploy a contract, you can check the [Stellar build doc](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/smart-contracts/getting-started) or the [deploy.example.ts](./deploy.example.ts) we provide for reference.

4. Using `@57block/stellar-resource-usage` in your code

**Scenario 1**

When you generate a typescript module using the `stellar contract bindings typescript` command, and use the `Client` in this module to call and execute the contract functions.
<!-- Please refer to [the link](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/developer-tools/cli/stellar-cli#stellar-contract-bindings-typescript) and/or [deploy.example.ts](./deploy.example.ts) if you want to learn more about **bindings**. -->

```ts
import { Keypair } from "@stellar/stellar-sdk";
import { basicNodeSigner } from "@stellar/stellar-sdk/contract";

import { Client, networks } from "yourPath/to/module";

const callContract = async () => {
  try {
    const keypair = Keypair.fromSecret(Bun.env.SECRET!);
    const pubkey = keypair.publicKey();

    const { signTransaction } = basicNodeSigner(
      keypair,
      networks.standalone.networkPassphrase
    );

    const _contract = new Client({
      contractId: networks.standalone.contractId,
      networkPassphrase: networks.standalone.networkPassphrase,
      rpcUrl: "http://localhost:8000/soroban/rpc",
      publicKey: pubkey, // process.env.SOROBAN_PUBLIC_KEY,
      allowHttp: true,
      signTransaction,
    });
    const res = await _contract.run({
      cpu: 700,
      mem: 180,
      set: 20,
      get: 40,
      events: 1,
      _txn: Buffer.alloc(71_680),
    });

    await res.signAndSend();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};

callContract();

```

While using `@57block/stellar-resource-usage`:

```ts
import { Keypair } from "@stellar/stellar-sdk";
import { basicNodeSigner } from "@stellar/stellar-sdk/contract";
// Add ResourceUsageClient
+ import { ResourceUsageClient } from "@57block/stellar-resource-usage";
import { Client, networks } from "./package/typescriptBinding/src";

const callContract = async () => {
  try {
    const keypair = Keypair.fromSecret(Bun.env.SECRET!);
    const pubkey = keypair.publicKey();

    const { signTransaction } = basicNodeSigner(
      keypair,
      networks.standalone.networkPassphrase
    );

-    const _contract = new Client({
+    const _contract = await ResourceUsageClient<Client>(Client, {
      contractId: networks.standalone.contractId,
      networkPassphrase: networks.standalone.networkPassphrase,
      rpcUrl: "http://localhost:8000/soroban/rpc",
      publicKey: pubkey, // process.env.SOROBAN_PUBLIC_KEY,
      allowHttp: true,
      signTransaction,
    });
    const res = await _contract.run({
      cpu: 700,
      mem: 180,
      set: 20,
      get: 40,
      events: 1,
      _txn: Buffer.alloc(71_680),
    });

    await res.signAndSend();

+   _contract.printTable();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};

callContract();
```

**Scenario 2**

Using `ResourceServer`.

Note: We'll refactor the function to avoid need user to pass secret key.

```ts
import { Keypair, Networks, nativeToScVal } from '@stellar/stellar-sdk';
import { ResourceServer } from '@57block/stellar-resource-usage';


const rpcUrl = 'http://localhost:9000/rpc';
const contractId = Bun.env.CONTRACT_ID;
const networkPassphrase = Networks.STANDALONE;

const args = [
  nativeToScVal(150, { type: 'u32' }),
  ...
]

const resourceServer = ResourceServer({
  networkPassphrase,
  secretKey, // Your secret key.
  rpcUrl,
});

resourceServer.calcResourceForTx([
  {
    contract: contractId,
    function: 'func',
    args,
  }
]);
```
5. Execute the file

For typescript files, we recommend using [bun](https://bun.sh/) to run directly, which makes the command very simple, just execute `bun run filepath`. Then you will see the reporter in the terminal.
